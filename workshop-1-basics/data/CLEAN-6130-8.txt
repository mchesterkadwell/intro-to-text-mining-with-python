with what we at present know is for the most part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very gradual character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire and this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of their conventional value the same principles which have swept away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church history and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively recent times are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow mere statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history as the facts he records probability is a powerful and troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands in brief to write a history we must know more than mere facts human nature viewed under an induction of extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished to form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great whole we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective probability of its details it is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know least and talk most homer socrates and shakespere have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow the personality of shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know he was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down when we have read plato or xenophon we think we know something of socrates when we have fairly read and examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant it has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief this system which has often comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testament has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries to question the existence of alexander the great would be a more excusable act than to believe in that of romulus to deny a fact related in herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the goodnatured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealized numa pompilius scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition concerning the author or authors of the iliad and odyssey what few authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle this can not be true because it is not true and that is not true because it can not be true such seems to be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and oblivion it is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which truth is the requisite most wanting before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus according to this document the city of cumae in æolia was at an early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of greece among the immigrants was menapolus the son of ithagenes although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl named critheis the girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of cleanax of argos it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of melesigenes from having been born near the river meles in boeotia whither critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation at this time continues our narrative there lived at smyrna a man named phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married engaged critheis to manage his household and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours so satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up they were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed melesigenes carried on his adopted father s school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to that city among these visitors one mentes from leucadia the modern santa maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times persuaded melesigenes to close his school and accompany him on his travels he promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that while he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met we may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia they reached ithaca here melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became much worse and mentes who was about to leave for leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named mentor the son of alcinor under his hospitable and intelligent host melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey the inhabitants of ithaca assert that it was here that melesigenes became blind but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune he then returned to smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry but poverty soon drove him to cumae having passed over the hermaean plain he arrived at neon teichos the new wall a colony of cumae here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias an armourer and up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived but poverty still drove him on and he went by way of larissa as being the most convenient road here the cumans say he composed an epitaph on gordius king of phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to cleobulus of lindus arrived at cumae he frequented the converzationes of the old men and delighted all by the charms of his poetry encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renowned they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet s demand but one man observed that if they were to feed homers they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people from this circumstance says the writer melesigenes acquired the name of homer for the cumans call blind men homers with a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory at phocoea homer was destined to experience another literary distress one thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable thestorides like some wouldbeliterary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him at his departure homer is said to have observed o thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems this at once determined him to set out for chios no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to start for erythrae a town of ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of jove the hospitable at erythrae homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of pithys here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the words of our author having set out from pithys homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing the dogs barked on his approach and he cried out glaucus for that was the name of the goatherd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from homer for or some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming he then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup the dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus o glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest first give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author having finished supper they banqueted afresh on conversation homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited at length they retired to rest but on the following morning glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with homer having left the goats in charge of a fellowservant he left homer at home promising to return quickly having arrived at bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey he paid little attention to what he said and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons however he bade him bring the stranger to him glaucus told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry to this day says chandler the most curious remain is that which has been named without reason the school of homer it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock the shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting she is represented as usual sitting the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back the area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity so successful was this school that homer realised a considerable fortune he married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other married a chian the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca in the odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness he also testifies his gratitude to phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction his celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit greece whither his reputation had now extended having it is said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention he sent out for samos here being recognized by a samian who had met with him in chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival he recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular in the spring he sailed for athens and arrived at the island of ios now ino where he fell extremely ill and died it is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen s children such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learned but by no means consistent series of investigations has led in doing so i profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability homer appeared the history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness the majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the nile its fountains will ever remain concealed such are the words in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved with no less truth and feeling he proceeds it seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible if the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light the creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part created far out of the reach of observation if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey for their origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the poet from this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue was homer an individual or were the iliad and odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets well has landor remarked some tell us there were twenty homers some deny that there was ever one it were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last we are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion to superior power of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us my opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good no man living venerates homer more than i do but greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to dry details before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poems at least of the iliad i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks we can not but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole the most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we would take the opinion of chantrey or westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of mr brodie or sir astley cooper there is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the lines of pope the critic eye that microscope of wit sees hairs and pores examines bit by bit how parts relate to parts or they to whole the body s harmony the beaming soul are things which kuster burmann wasse shall see when man s whole frame is obvious to a flea long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems the grave and cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation the hymn to apollo the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of homer ever arose so far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim at the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentley remarking that homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment these loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratus time about five hundred years after two french writers hedelin and perrault avowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness indeed it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the words of grote half a century ago the acute and valuable prolegomena of f a wolf turning to account the venetian scholia which had then been recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text a considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portions of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of peisistratus in the sixth century before christ as a step towards that conclusion wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity the absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early greeks was thus one of the points in wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey by nitzsch and other leading opponents of wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning to me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates in reference to the homeric poems are nowise admissible but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth century before the christian aera few things in my opinion can be more improbable and mr payne knight opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than wolf himself the traces of writing in greece even in the seventh century before the christian aera are exceedingly trifling we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus simonides of amorgus kallinus tyrtaeus xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer is in the famous ordinance of solon with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say those who maintain the homeric poems to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry for they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read but recited and heard but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially nonreading and nonwriting and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of demodokus in the odyssey as from that of the blind bard of chios in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydides as well as the general tenor of grecian legend identifies with homer himself the author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest the loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved if chaucer s poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of dryden than the rough quaint noble original at what period continues grote these poems or indeed any other greek poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of solon if in the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the question a once suggests itself what were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer for whom was a written iliad necessary not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce not for the general public they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival the only persons for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early greece a time when no such reading class existed if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece is the middle of the seventh century before the christian aera bc to bc the age of terpander kallinus archilochus simonides of amorgus c i ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of grecian poetry and music the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet the nearest approaching to the sense it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written words of the homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebais as the production of homer there seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newlyformed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the homeric poems and other old epics the thebais and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odyssey began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century bc and the opening of egypt to grecian commerce which took place about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon a reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of solon fifty years afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we can not help feeling the force of the following observations there are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler if the great poets who flourished at the bright period of grecian song of which alas we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichorus anacreon and simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys to whom the name of helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age however mr knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form however finally the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics still it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram if however not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation in later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors but amid all the traditions of the glories of early greece embodied in the iliad the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part even the few passages which relate to their ancestors mr knight suspects to be interpolations it is possible indeed that in its leading outline the iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and halfkindred empire of the laomedontiadae the chieftain of thessaly from his valour and the number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid could france have given birth to a tasso tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem if however the homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalry it is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the french should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors or at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age to return to the wolfian theory while it is to be confessed that wolfs objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over we can not help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis nor is lachmann s modification of his theory any better he divides the first twentytwo books of the iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus this as grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the socalled sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of achilles elphenor chief of the euboeans tlepolemus of the rhodians pandarus of the lycians odius of the halizonians pirous and acamas of the thracians none of these heroes again make their appearance and we can but agree with colonel mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel the discrepancy by which pylaemenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his son s funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory and of lachmann s modifications with the character of peisistratus but he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct in short a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of preexisting songs without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation the friends or literary employes of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of peisistratus nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries in the greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ships the amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the oriental and egyptian veins of religion c familiar to the latter epoch these alterations onomakritus and the other literary friends of peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate everything in the two great homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than peisistratus indeed even the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before christ and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinus in some cases even by arktinus and hesiod as genuine homeric matter as far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations in bc our first trustworthy mark of grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the bestauthenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poems considered in reference to grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the antihistorical character of the greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition on the whole i am inclined to believe that the labours of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although i must confess that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours at the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the work of peisistratus i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subject i can not however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the spartan confucius i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency it is as follows no doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse in excellent music among them many of these like those of the negroes in the united states were extemporaneous and allusive to events passing around them but what was passing around them the grand events of a spiritstirring war occurrences likely to impress themselves as the mystical legends of former times had done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with troy were merely recitations with an intonation then followed a species of recitative probably with an intoned burden tune next followed as it aided the memory considerably it was at this period about four hundred years after the war that a poet flourished of the name of melesigenes or moeonides but most probably the former he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own this poem now exists under the title of the odyssea the author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him he therefore called it the poem of homeros or the collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people s ideas for as grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have recast preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so while employed on the wild legend of odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the achilleis grew under his hand unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the cid into a chronicle history named the iliad melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assemblies and agoras however solon first and then peisistratus and afterwards aristoteles and others revised the poems and restored the works of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poems in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he homer or melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit i feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary the minutiae of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would be gross inconsistency but while i appreciate its importance in a philological view i am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value especially in poetry three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his maecenas or africanus he would probably have adopted moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so per accidens i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from herodotus down to loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute points without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune but it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand if we compare the theories of knight wolf lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer one rejects what another considers the turningpoint of his theory one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty justus lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by four different authors now i will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseology a phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves in their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad with equal sagacity father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the æneid of virgil and the satires of horace were literary deceptions now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning nay the refined acuteness which scholars like wolf have bestowed upon this subject i must express my fears that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity nor can i help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation i have already expressed my belief that the labours of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poems of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio scaliger and others but after all the main fault in all the homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus there is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of homer our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better while however i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust still i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a wellstocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment but it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result a blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality in fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions nay even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination but unless there be some grand pervading principle some invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth traditions the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as i must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained we are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter but we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury as an achilles or a hector and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer we shall feel that the poems of homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation no poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius he held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth his poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of glory his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies if it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations from the fields of asia to the forests of hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the apotheosis of homer is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition the more we read and the more we think think as becomes the readers of homer the more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other as the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to homer are not included in pope s translation i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice this poem says coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient date the text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homer s genius others have attributed it to the same pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the greeks before the age of the ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings as to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of the iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in europe and of many in asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age knight infers from the usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of diphthera skin which according to herod was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock v is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in pope s design i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition pope was not a grecian his whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation there are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original and in those days what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet s meaning his words were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as pope s iliad had fair reason to be satisfied it would be absurd therefore to test pope s translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself a work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize merely because buttmann loewe and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive far be it from us to defend the faults of pope especially when we think of chapman s fine bold rough old english far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer might be but we can still dismiss popes iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow as to the notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader having some little time since translated all the works of homer for another publisher i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text but popes version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages from our english homer milton in the latter task i can not pretend to novelty but i trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim but if i have made pope s translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished theodore alois buckley christ church pope s preface to the iliad of homer homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with and perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature our author s work is a wild paradise where if we can not see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet s imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it it is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi in a very few even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer i shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them of this sort is the main story of an epic poem the return of ulysses the settlement of the trojans in italy or the like that of the iliad is the anger of achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homer s poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his the other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus if ulysses visit the shades the æneas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is æneas by dido and rinaldo by armida if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek authors thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the loves of dido and æneas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius and several others in the same manner to proceed to the allegorical fable if we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us how fertile will that imagination appear which as able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it for when the mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry we come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of ajax is heavy and selfconfiding of hector active and vigilant the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one for example the main characters of ulysses and nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular but they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer his characters of valour are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus cloanthus or the rest in like manner it may be remarked of statius s heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon c they have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all others the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem everything in it has manner as aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any person s mouth upon the same occasion as many of his persons have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by any painter but homer nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men his expression is like the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compound epithets this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images on this last consideration i can not but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined we see the motion of hectors plumes in the epithet korythaiolos the landscape of mount neritus in that of einosiphyllos and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler æolic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author s beauties in this kind in his treatise of the composition of words it suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention it is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these heads i have no way derogated from his character nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in one we most admire the man in the other the work homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream when we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like æneas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation but after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances thus homer has his speaking horses and virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madame dacier that those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting phoebus the blueeyed pallas the swiftfooted achilles c which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit as for the epithets of great men mons boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander the son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic c homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince c if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a further conjecture hesiod dividing the world into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demigods and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed now among the divine honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homer s having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the æneis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the æneis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as æneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil others select those particular passages of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities c to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation this is the method of mons de la mott who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him what he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted everything a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity methinks i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion for a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase perhaps the mixture of some graecisms and old words after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen can not be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language there are two peculiarities in homer s diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties i speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions many of the former can not be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloudcompelling jove c as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious some that can not be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods others that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced for example the epithet of apollo hekaebolos or farshooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment as for homer s repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it it only remains to speak of the versification homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in the latin i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavoured at this beauty upon the whole i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey ver where he has spun twenty verses out of two he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussy damboise c in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness his poetry as well as ogilby s is too mean for criticism it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry what i would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns next these the archbishop of cambray s telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossu s admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning for to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i can not repeat without vanity i was obliged to sir richard steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public dr swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend the humanity and frankness of sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting on any occasion i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of homer i must add the names of mr rowe and dr parnell though i shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning the favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay so complete a praise read homer once and you can read no more for all books else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the books you need that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad i can not deny myself the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them mr stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honoured in a share of his friendship i must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the university of oxford and i can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself the iliad book i argument the contention of achilles and agamemnon in the war of troy the greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns and taken from thence

embodied fly with noise and order through the midway sky to pigmy nations wounds and death they bring and all the war descends upon the wing but silent breathing rage resolved and skill d by mutual aids to fix a doubtful field swift march the greeks the rapid dust around darkening arises from the labour d ground thus from his flaggy wings when notus sheds a night of vapours round the mountain heads swiftgliding mists the dusky fields invade to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey lost and confused amidst the thicken d day so

of fame whom troy sent forth the beauteous paris came in form a god the panther s speckled hide flow d oer his armour with an easy pride his bended bow across his shoulders flung his sword beside him negligently hung two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace and dared the bravest of the grecian race as thus with glorious air and proud disdain he boldly stalk d the foremost on the plain him menelaus loved of mars espies with heart elated and with joyful eyes so joys a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat his bulky prize appear eager he seizes and devours the slain press d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground from his high chariot him approaching near the beauteous champion views with marks of fear smit with a conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserved to find as when some shepherd from the rustling trees shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees trembling and pale he starts with wild affright and all confused precipitates his flight so from the king the shining warrior flies and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies as godlike hector sees the prince retreat he thus upbraids him with a generous heat unhappy paris but to women brave so fairly form d and only to deceive oh hadst thou died when first thou sawst the light or died at least before thy nuptial rite

claim the wretch and hero find their prize the same alike regretted in the dust he lies who yields ignobly or who bravely dies of all my dangers all my glorious pains a life of labours lo what fruit remains as the bold bird her helpless young attends from danger guards them and from want defends in search of prey she wings the spacious air and with the untasted food supplies her care for thankless greece such hardships have i braved her wives her infants by my labours saved long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood and sweat laborious days in dust and blood i sack d twelve ample cities on the main and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain then at atrides haughty feet were laid the wealth i gathered and the spoils i made your mighty monarch these in peace possess d some few

answer what remains to do your king ulysses may consult with you what needs he the defence this arm can make has he not walls no human force can shake has he not fenced his guarded navy round with piles with ramparts and a trench profound and will not these the wonders he has done repel the rage of priam s single son there was a time t was when for greece i fought when hector s prowess no such wonders wrought he kept the verge of troy nor dared to wait achilles fury at the scaean gate he tried it once and scarce was saved by fate but now those ancient enmities are oer tomorrow we the favouring gods implore then shall you see our parting vessels crown d and hear with oars the hellespont resound the third day hence shall pthia greet our sails if mighty neptune send propitious gales

to the army the distress of agamemnon is described in the most lively manner he takes no rest that night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving all possible methods for the public safety menelaus nestor ulysses and diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains they call a council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemies camp to learn their posture and discover their intentions diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise and makes choice of ulysses for his companion in their passage they surprise dolon whom hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the grecians from him they are informed of the situation of the trojan and auxiliary forces and particularly of rhesus and the thracians who were lately arrived they pass on with success kill rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp the same night continues the scene lies in the two camps all night the chiefs before their vessels lay and lost in sleep the labours of the day all but the king with various thoughts oppress d his country s cares lay rolling in his breast as when by lightnings jove s ethereal power foretels the rattling hail or weighty shower or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore or bids the brazen throat of war to roar by fits one flash succeeds as one expires and heaven flames thick with momentary fires so bursting frequent from atrides breast sighs following sighs his inward fears confess d now oer the fields dejected he surveys from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze hears in the passing wind their music blow and marks distinct the voices of the foe now looking backwards to the fleet and coast anxious he sorrows for the endangered host he rends his hair in sacrifice to jove and sues to him that ever lives above inly he groans while glory and despair divide his heart and wage a double war a thousand cares his labouring breast revolves to seek sage nestor now the chief resolves with him in wholesome counsels to debate what yet remains to save the afflicted state he rose and first he cast his mantle round next on his feet the shining sandals bound a lion s yellow spoils his back conceal d his warlike hand a pointed javelin held meanwhile his brother press d with equal woes alike denied the gifts of soft repose laments for greece that in his cause before so much had suffer d and must suffer more a leopard s spotted hide his shoulders spread a brazen helmet glitter d on his head thus with a javelin in his hand he went to wake atrides in the royal tent already waked atrides he descried his armour buckling at his vessel s side joyful they met the spartan thus begun why puts my brother his bright armour on sends he some spy amidst these silent hours to try yon camp and watch the trojan powers but say what hero shall sustain that task such bold exploits uncommon courage ask guideless alone through night s dark shade to go and midst a hostile camp explore the foe to whom the king in such distress we stand no vulgar counsel our affairs demand greece to preserve is now no easy part but asks high wisdom deep design and art for jove averse our humble prayer denies and bows his head to hector s sacrifice what eye has witness d or what ear believed in one great day by one great arm achieved such wondrous deeds as hector s hand has done and we beheld the last revolving sun what honours the beloved of jove adorn sprung from no god and of no goddess born yet such his acts as greeks unborn shall tell and curse the battle where their fathers fell now speed thy hasty course along the fleet there call great ajax and the prince of crete ourself to hoary nestor will repair to keep the guards on duty be his care for nestor s influence best that quarter guides whose son with merion oer the watch presides to whom the spartan these thy orders borne say shall i stay or with despatch return there shall thou stay the king of men replied else may we miss to meet without a guide the paths so many and the camp so wide still with your voice the slothful soldiers raise urge by their fathers fame their future praise forget we now our state and lofty birth not titles here but works must prove our worth to labour is the lot of man below and when jove gave us life he gave us woe this said each parted to his several cares the king to nestor s sable ship repairs the sage protector of the greeks he found stretch d in his bed with all his arms around the variouscolour d scarf the shield he rears the shining helmet and the pointed spears the dreadful weapons of the warrior s rage that old in arms disdain d the peace of age then leaning on his hand his watchful head the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said what art thou speak that on designs unknown while others sleep thus range the camp alone seekst thou some friend or nightly sentinel stand off approach not but thy purpose tell o son of neleus thus the king rejoin d pride of the greeks and glory of thy kind lo here the wretched agamemnon stands the unhappy general of the grecian bands whom jove decrees with daily cares to bend and woes that only with his life shall end scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain and scarce my heart support its load of pain no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known confused and sad i wander thus alone with fears distracted with no fix d design and all my people s miseries are mine if aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest impart thy counsel and assist thy friend now let us jointly to the trench descend at every gate the fainting guard excite tired with the toils of day and watch of night else may the sudden foe our works invade so near and favour d by the gloomy shade to him thus nestor trust the powers above nor think proud hector s hopes confirm d by jove how ill agree the views of vain mankind and the wise counsels of the eternal mind audacious hector if the gods ordain that great achilles rise and rage again what toils attend thee and what woes remain lo faithful nestor thy command obeys the care is next our other chiefs to raise ulysses diomed we chiefly need meges for strength oileus famed for speed some other be despatch d of nimbler feet to those tall ships remotest of the fleet where lie great ajax and the king of crete to rouse

preventing every part perform d by you for strong necessity our toils demands claims all our hearts and urges all our hands to whom the king with reverence we allow thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now my generous brother is of gentle kind he seems remiss but bears a valiant mind through too much deference to our sovereign sway content to follow when we lead the way but now our ills industrious to prevent long ere the rest he rose and sought my tent the chiefs you named already at his call prepare to meet us near the navywall assembling there between the trench and gates near the nightguards our chosen council waits then none said nestor shall his rule withstand for great examples justify command with that the venerable warrior rose the shining greaves his manly legs enclose

through the sleeping crowd stopp d at ulysses tent and call d aloud ulysses sudden as the voice was sent awakes starts up and issues from his tent what new distress what sudden cause of fright thus leads you wandering in the silent night o prudent chief the pylian sage replied wise as thou art be now thy wisdom tried whatever means of safety can be sought whatever counsels can inspire our thought whatever methods or to fly or fight all all depend on this important night he heard return d and took his painted shield then join d the chiefs and follow d through the field without his tent bold diomed they found all sheathed in arms his brave companions round each sunk in sleep extended on the field his head reclining on his bossy shield a wood of spears stood by that fix d upright shot from their flashing points a quivering light a bull s black hide composed the hero s bed a splendid carpet roll d beneath his head then with his foot old nestor gently shakes the slumbering chief and in these words awakes rise son of tydeus to the brave and strong rest seems inglorious and the night too long but sleepst thou now when from yon hill the foe hangs oer the fleet and shades our walls below at this soft slumber from his eyelids fled the warrior saw the hoary chief and said wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows though years and honours bid thee seek repose let younger greeks our sleeping warriors wake ill fits thy age these toils to undertake my friend he answered generous is thy care these toils my subjects and my sons might bear their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire but now the last despair surrounds our host no hour must pass no moment must be lost each single greek in this conclusive strife stands on the sharpest edge of death or life yet if my years thy kind regard engage employ thy youth as i employ my age succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest he serves me most who serves his country best this said the hero oer his shoulders flung a lion s spoils that to his ankles hung then seized his ponderous lance and strode along meges the bold with ajax famed for speed the warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard a wakeful squadron each in arms prepared the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep and couching close repel invading sleep so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain with toil protected from the prowling train when the gaunt lioness with hunger bold springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold through breaking woods her rustling course they hear loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear of hounds and men they start they gaze around watch every side and turn to every sound thus watch d the grecians cautious of surprise each voice each motion drew their ears and eyes each step of passing feet increased the affright and hostile troy was ever full in sight nestor with joy the wakeful band survey d and thus accosted through the gloomy shade t is well my sons your nightly cares employ else must our host become the scorn of troy watch thus and greece shall live the hero said then oer the trench the

place there was yet undefiled with gore the spot where hector stopp d his rage before when night descending from his vengeful hand reprieved the relics of the grecian band the plain beside with mangled corps was spread and all his progress mark d by heaps of dead there sat the mournful kings when neleus son the council opening in these words begun is there said he a chief so greatly brave his life to hazard and his country save lives there a man who singly dares to go to yonder camp or seize some straggling foe or favour d by the night approach so near their speech their counsels and designs to hear if to besiege our navies they prepare or troy once more must be the seat of war this could he learn and to our peers recite and pass unharm d the dangers of the night what fame were his through all succeeding days while phoebus shines or men have tongues to praise what gifts his grateful country would bestow what must not greece to her deliverer owe a sable ewe each leader should provide with each a sable lambkin by her side at every rite his share should be increased and his the foremost honours of the feast fear held them mute alone untaught to fear tydides spoke the man you seek is here through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way some god within commands and i obey but let some other chosen warrior join to raise my hopes and second my design by mutual confidence and mutual aid great deeds are done and great discoveries made the wise new prudence from the wise acquire and one brave hero fans another s fire contending leaders at the word arose each generous breast with emulation glows so brave a task each ajax strove to share bold merion strove and nestor s valiant heir the spartan wish d the second place to gain and great ulysses wish d nor wish d in vain then thus the king of men the contest ends thou first of warriors and thou best of friends undaunted diomed what chief to join in this great enterprise is only thine just be thy choice without affection made to birth or office no respect be paid let worth determine here the monarch spake and inly trembled for his brother s sake then thus the godlike diomed rejoin d my choice declares the impulse of

remains thus having spoke with generous ardour press d in arms terrific their huge limbs they dress d a twoedged falchion thrasymed the brave and ample buckler to tydides gave then in a leathern helm

maid so still continue to the race thine aid a youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke untamed unconscious of the galling yoke with ample forehead and with spreading horns whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns the heroes pray d and pallas from the skies accords their vow succeeds their enterprise now like two lions panting for the prey with dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain through dust through blood oer arms and hills of slain nor less bold hector and the sons of troy on high designs the wakeful hours employ the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed who thus the counsels of his breast proposed what glorious man for high attempts prepared dares greatly venture for a rich reward of yonder fleet a bold discovery make what watch they keep and what resolves they take if now subdued they meditate their flight and spent with toil neglect the watch of night his be the chariot that shall please him most of all the plunder of the vanquish d host his the fair steeds that all the rest excel and his the glory to have served so well a youth there was among the tribes of troy dolon his name eumedes only boy five girls beside the reverend herald told rich was the son in brass and rich in gold not bless d by nature with the charms of face but swift of foot and matchless in the race hector he said my courage bids me meet this high achievement and explore the fleet but first exalt thy sceptre to the skies and swear to grant me the demanded prize the immortal coursers and the glittering car that bear pelides through the ranks of war encouraged thus no idle scout i go fulfil thy wish their whole intention know even to the royal tent pursue my way and all their counsels all their aims betray the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high attesting thus the monarch of the sky be witness thou immortal lord of all whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall by none but dolon shall this prize be borne and him alone the immortal steeds adorn thus hector swore the gods were call d in vain but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain across his back the bended bow he flung a wolf s grey hide around his shoulders hung a ferret s downy fur his helmet lined and in his hand a pointed javelin shined then never to return he sought the shore and trod the path his feet must tread no more scarce had he pass d the steeds and trojan throng still bending forward as he coursed along when on the hollow way the approaching tread ulysses mark d and thus to diomed o friend i hear some step of hostile feet moving this way or hastening to the fleet some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main or nightly pillager that strips the slain yet let him pass and win a little space then rush behind him and prevent his pace but if too swift of foot he flies before confine his course along the fleet and shore betwixt the camp and him our spears employ and intercept his hoped return to troy with that they stepp d aside and stoop d their head as dolon pass d behind a heap of dead along the path the spy unwary flew soft at just distance both the chiefs pursue so distant they and such the space between as when two teams of mules divide the green to whom the hind like shares of land allows when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs now dolon listening heard them as they pass d hector he thought had sent and check d his haste till scarce at distance of a javelin s throw no voice succeeding he perceived the foe as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind now lost now seen they intercept his way and from the herd still turn the flying prey so fast and with such fears the trojan flew so close so constant the bold greeks pursue now almost on the fleet the dastard falls and mingles with the guards that watch the walls when brave tydides stopp d a genrous thought inspired by pallas in his bosom wrought lest on the foe some forward greek advance and snatch the glory from his lifted lance then thus aloud whoeer thou art remain this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain he said and high in air the weapon cast which wilful err d and oer his shoulder pass d then fix d in earth against the trembling wood the wretch stood propp d and quiver d as he stood a sudden palsy seized his turning head his loose teeth chatter d and his colour

the silent fields in dead of night camst thou the secrets of our camp to find by hector prompted or thy daring mind or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead then thus pale dolon with a fearful look still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook hither i came by hector s words deceived much did he promise rashly i believed no less a bribe than great achilles car and those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war urged me unwilling this attempt to make to learn what counsels what resolves you take if now subdued you fix your hopes on flight and tired with toils neglect the watch of night bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize ulysses with a scornful smile replies far other rulers those proud steeds demand and scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand even great achilles scarce their rage can tame achilles sprung from an immortal dame but say be faithful and the truth recite where lies encamp d the trojan chief tonight where stand his coursers in what quarter sleep their other princes tell what watch they keep say since this conquest what their counsels are or here to combat from their city far or back to ilion s walls transfer the war ulysses thus and thus eumedes son what dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own hector the peers assembling in his tent a council holds at ilus monument no certain guards the nightly watch partake whereer yon fires ascend the trojans wake anxious for troy the guard the natives keep safe in their cares the auxiliar forces sleep whose wives and infants from the danger far discharge their

receive them while jupiter juno and minerva give the signals of war agamemnon bears all before him and hector is commanded by jupiter who sends iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy ulysses and diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter being wounded by paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till menelaus and ajax rescue him hector comes against ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the greeks in the meantime machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by paris and carried from the fight in nestor s chariot achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sent patroclus to inquire which of the greeks was wounded in that manner nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered tending to put patroclus upon persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in achilles armour patroclus on his return meets eurypylus also wounded and assists him in that distress this book opens with the eight andtwentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth books the scene lies in the field near the monument of ilus the saffron morn with early blushes spread now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with newborn day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light when baleful eris sent by jove s command the torch of discord blazing in her hand through the red skies her bloody sign extends and wrapt in tempests oer the fleet descends high on ulysses bark her horrid stand she took and thunder d through the seas and land even ajax and achilles heard the sound whose ships remote the guarded navy bound thence the black fury through the grecian throng with horror sounds the loud orthian song the navy shakes and at the dire alarms each bosom boils each warrior starts to arms no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn illustration the descent of discord the descent of discord the king of men his hardy host inspires

those counsels which i judge the best i tell the faithful dictates of my breast to speak his thoughts is every freeman s right in peace in war in council and in fight and all i move deferring to thy sway but tends to raise that power which i obey then hear my words nor may my words be vain seek not this day the grecian ships to gain for sure to warn us jove his omen sent and thus my mind explains

though we gird with fires the grecian fleet though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed more woes shall follow and more heroes bleed so bodes my soul and bids me thus advise for thus a skilful seer would read the skies to him then hector with disdain return d fierce as he spoke his eyes with fury burn d are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue thy will is partial not thy reason wrong or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent what coward counsels would thy madness move against the word the will reveal

sky your wings extend or where the suns arise or where descend to right to left unheeded take your way while i the dictates of high heaven obey without a sign his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his country s cause but why shouldst thou suspect the war s success none fears it more as none promotes it less though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire troy and her sons may find a general grave but thou canst live for thou canst be a slave yet should the fears that wary mind suggests spread their cold poison through our soldiers breasts my javelin can revenge so base a part and free the soul that quivers in thy heart furious he spoke and rushing to the wall calls on his host his host obey the call with ardour follow where their leader flies redoubling clamours thunder in the skies jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of ide and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great hector the predestined day strong in themselves but stronger in his aid close to the works their rigid siege they laid in vain the mounds and massy beams defend while these they undermine and those they rend upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall and heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms shield touching shield a long refulgent row whence hissing darts incessant rain below the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower and rouse with flame divine the grecian power the generous impulse every greek

each may act his part a day to fire the brave and warm the cold to gain new glories or augment the old urge those who stand and those who faint excite drown hector s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight conquest not safety fill the thoughts of all seek not your fleet but sally from the wall so jove once more may drive their routed train and troy lie trembling in her walls again their ardour kindles all the grecian powers and now the stones descend in heavier showers as when high jove his sharp artillery forms and opes his cloudy magazine of storms in winter s bleak un comfortable reign a snowy

sandy shore bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen and one bright waste hides all the works of men the circling seas alone absorbing all drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall so from each side increased the stony rain and the white ruin rises oer the plain thus godlike hector and his troops contend to force the ramparts and the gates to rend nor troy could conquer nor the greeks would yield till great sarpedon tower d amid the field for mighty jove inspired with martial flame his matchless son and urged him on to fame in arms he shines conspicuous from afar and bears aloft his

drives him on the foes he views the towers and meditates their fall to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall then casting on his friend an ardent look fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke why boast we glaucus our extended reign where xanthus streams enrich the lycian plain our numerous herds that range the fruitful field and hills where vines their purple harvest yield our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown d our feasts enhanced with music s sprightly sound why on those shores are we with joy survey d admired as heroes and as gods obey d unless great acts superior merit prove and vindicate the bounteous powers above t is ours the dignity they give to grace the first in valour as the first in place that when with wondering eyes our martial bands behold our deeds transcending our commands such they may cry deserve the sovereign state whom those that envy dare not imitate could all our care elude the gloomy grave which claims no less the fearful and the brave for lust of fame i should not vainly dare in fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war but since alas ignoble age must come disease and death s inexorable doom the life which others pay let us bestow and give to fame what we to nature owe brave though we fall and honour d if we live or let us glory gain or glory give he said his words the listening chief inspire with equal warmth and rouse the warrior s fire the troops pursue their leaders with delight rush to the foe and claim the promised fight menestheus from on high the storm beheld threatening the fort and blackening in the field around the walls he gazed to view from far what aid appear d to avert the approaching war and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood of fight insatiate prodigal of blood in vain he calls the din of helms and shields rings to the skies and echoes through the fields the brazen hinges fly the walls resound heaven trembles roar the mountains thunders all the ground then thus to thoos hence with speed he said and urge the bold ajaces to our aid their strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war hither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force but if too fiercely there the foes contend let telamon at least our towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe swift at the word the herald speeds along the lofty ramparts through the martial throng and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore opposed in combat on the dusty shore ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands your aid said thoos peteus son demands your strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war thither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force

reluctant from the unfinish d fight divine sarpedon with regret beheld disabled glaucus slowly quit the field his beating breast with generous ardour glows he springs to fight and flies upon the foes alcmaon first was doom d his force to feel deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel then from the yawning wound with fury tore the spear pursued by gushing streams of gore down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground swift to the battlement the victor flies tugs with full force and every nerve applies it shakes the ponderous stones disjointed yield the rolling ruins smoke along the field a mighty breach appears the walls lie bare and like a deluge rushes in the war at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow and ajax sends his javelin at the foe fix d in his belt the feather d weapon stood and through his buckler drove the trembling wood but jove was present in the dire debate to shield his offspring and avert his fate the

the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers as on the confines of adjoining grounds two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds they tug they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound loud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound the copious slaughter covers all the shore and the high ramparts drip with human gore as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal

loud repeated cries advance ye trojans lend your valiant hands haste to the fleet and toss the blazing brands they hear they run and gathering at his call raise scaling engines and ascend the wall around the works a wood of glittering spears shoots up and all the rising host appears a ponderous stone bold hector heaved to throw pointed above and rough and gross below not two strong men the

rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night and shakes two shining spears a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came and from his eyeballs flash d the living flame he moves a god resistless

oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessels the ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx and put a stop to hector and the trojans several deeds of valour are performed meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of idomeneus this occasions a conversation between those two warriors who return

from high heaven to shun the single fight with thetis godlike son more safe to combat in the mingled band nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand he hears obedient to the god of light and plunged

billows braves arm d with his sword high brandish d oer the waves now down he plunges now he whirls it round deep groan d the waters with the dying sound repeated wounds the reddening river dyed and

amid the flood the young lycaon in his passage stood the son of priam whom the hero s hand but late made captive in his father s land as from a sycamore his sounding steel lopp d the green arms to

sadder journey to the shades below his wellknown face when great achilles eyed the helm and visor he had cast aside with wild affright and dropp d upon the field his useless lance and unavailing

held down hercules thus while he spoke the trojan pale with fears approach d and sought his knees with suppliant tears loth as he was to yield his youthful breath and his soul shivering at the approach of death achilles raised the spear prepared to wound he kiss d his feet extended on the ground and while above the spear suspended stood longing to dip its thirsty point in blood one hand embraced them close one stopp d the dart while thus these melting words attempt his heart thy wellknown captive great achilles see once more lycaon trembles at thy knee some pity to a suppliant s name

the day shall come which nothing can avert when by the spear the arrow or the dart by night or day by force or by design impending death and certain fate are mine die then he said and as the word he spoke the fainting stripling sank before the stroke his hand forgot its grasp and left the spear while all his trembling frame confess d his fear sudden achilles his broad sword display d and buried in his neck the reeking blade prone fell the youth and panting on the land the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand the victor to the stream the carcase gave and thus insults him floating on the wave

is atoned patroclus honour d shade and the short absence of achilles paid these boastful words provoked the raging god with fury swells the violated flood what means divine may yet the power employ to check achilles and to rescue troy meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dare the great asteropeus to mortal war the son of pelagon whose lofty line flows from the source of axius stream divine fair peribaea s love the god had crown d with all his refluent waters circled round on him achilles rush d he fearless stood and shook two spears advancing from the flood the flood impell d him on pelides

deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle earth and quiver d there then from his side the sword pelides drew and on his foe with double fury flew the foe thrice tugg d and shook the rooted wood repulsive of his might the weapon stood the fourth he tries to break the spear in vain bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain his belly open d with a ghastly wound the reeking entrails pour upon the ground beneath the hero s feet he panting lies and his eye darkens and his spirit flies while the proud victor thus triumphing said his radiant armour tearing from the dead so ends thy glory such the fate they prove who strive presumptuous with the sons of jove sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line but great saturnius is the source of mine how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny of peleus æacus and jove am i the race of these superior far to those as he that thunders to the stream that flows what rivers can scamander might have shown but jove he dreads nor wars against his son even achelous might contend in vain and all the roaring billows of the main the eternal ocean from whose fountains flow the seas the rivers and the springs below the thundering voice of jove abhors to hear and in his deep abysses shakes with fear he said then from the bank his javelin tore and left the breathless warrior in his gore the floating tides the bloody carcase lave and beat against it wave succeeding wave till roll d between the banks it lies the food of curling eels and fishes of the flood all scatter d round the stream their mightiest slain the amazed paeonians scour along the plain he vents his fury on the flying crew thrasius astyplus and mnesus slew mydon thersilochus with ænius fell and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell but from the bottom of his gulfs profound scamander spoke the shores return d the sound o first of mortals for the gods are thine in valour matchless and in force divine if jove have given thee every trojan head t is not on

amaze a god in human form confess d before his eyes the river thus and thus the chief replies o sacred stream thy word we shall obey but not till troy the destined vengeance pay not till within her towers the perjured train shall pant and tremble at our arms again not till proud hector guardian of her wall or stain this lance or see achilles fall he said and drove with fury on the foe then to the godhead of the silver bow the yellow flood began o son of jove was not the mandate of the sire above full and express that phoebus should employ his sacred arrows in defence of troy and make her conquer till hyperion s fall in awful darkness hide the face of all he spoke in vain the chief without dismay ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way then rising in his rage above the shores from all his deep the bellowing river roars huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast and round the banks the ghastly dead are toss d while all before the billows ranged on high a watery bulwark screen the bands who fly now bursting on his head with thundering sound the falling deluge whelms the hero round his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide his feet upborne scarce the strong flood divide sliddering and staggering on the border stood a spreading elm that overhung the flood he seized a bending bough his steps to stay the plant uprooted to his weight gave way heaving the bank and undermining all loud flash the waters to the rushing fall of the thick foliage the large trunk displayd bridged the rough flood across the hero stayd on this his weight and raised upon his hand leap d from the channel and regain d the land then blacken d the wild waves the murmur rose the god pursues a huger billow throws and bursts the bank ambitious to destroy the man whose fury is the fate of troy he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace swiftest and strongest of the aerial race far as a spear can fly achilles springs at every bound his clanging armour rings now here now there he turns on every side and winds his course before the following tide the waves flow after wheresoeer he wheels and gather fast and murmur at his heels so when a peasant to his garden brings soft rills of water from the bubbling springs and calls the floods from high to bless his bowers and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers soon as he clears whateer their passage stay d and marks the future current with his spade swift oer the rolling pebbles down the hills louder and louder purl the falling rills before him scattering they prevent his pains and shine in mazy wanderings oer the plains still flies achilles but before his eyes still swift scamander rolls whereer he flies not all his speed escapes the rapid floods the first of men but not a match for gods oft as he turn d the torrent to oppose and bravely try if all the powers were foes so oft the surge in watery mountains spread beats on his back or bursts upon his head yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves and still indignant bounds above the waves tired by the tides his knees relax with toil wash d from beneath him slides the slimy soil when thus his eyes on heaven s expansion thrown forth bursts the hero with an angry groan is there no god achilles to befriend no power to avert his miserable end prevent o jove this ignominious date and make my future life the sport of fate of all heaven s oracles believed in vain but most of thetis must her son complain by phoebus darts she prophesied my fall in glorious arms before the trojan wall oh had i died in fields of battle warm

chief the power of ocean first forbear thy fear o son of peleus lo thy gods appear behold from jove descending to thy aid propitious neptune and the blueeyed maid stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave t is not thy fate to glut his angry wave but thou the counsel heaven suggests attend nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend till troy receive her flying sons till all her routed squadrons pant behind their wall hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and hector s blood shall smoke upon thy lance thine is the glory doom d thus spake the gods then swift ascended to the bright abodes stung with new ardour thus by heaven impell d he springs impetuous and invades the field oer all the expanded plain the waters spread heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead floating

stops the hero s course while pallas fills him with immortal force with equal rage indignant xanthus roars and lifts his billows and oerwhelms his shores then thus to simois haste my brother flood and check this mortal that controls a god our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight and ilion tumble from her towery height call then thy subject streams and bid them roar from all thy fountains swell thy watery store with broken rocks and with a load of dead charge the black surge and pour it on his head mark how resistless through the floods he goes and boldly bids the warring gods be foes but

horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound and wide beneath them groans the rending ground jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and views contending gods with careless eyes the power of battles lifts his brazen spear and first assaults the radiant queen of war what moved thy madness thus to disunite ethereal minds and mix all heaven in fight what wonder this when in thy frantic mood thou drovest a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore he spoke and smote the longresounding shield which bears jove s thunder on its dreadful field the adamantine aegis of her sire that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand a stone the limit of the neighbouring land there fix d from eldest times black craggy vast this at the heavenly homicide she cast thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size and seven broad acres covers as he lies the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound loud oer the fields his ringing arms resound the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles and glorying thus the prostrate god reviles hast thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minerva s force transcends thy own juno whom thou rebellious darest withstand corrects thy folly thus by pallas hand thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace and partial aid to troy s perfidious race the goddess spoke and turn d her eyes away that beaming round diffused celestial day jove s cyprian daughter stooping on the land lent to the wounded god her

fight the god of ocean dares the god of light what sloth has seized us when the fields around ring with conflicting powers and heaven returns the sound shall ignominious we with shame retire no deed perform d to our olympian sire come prove thy arm for first the war to wage suits not my greatness or superior age rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own and guard the race of proud laomedon hast thou forgot how at the monarch s prayer we shared the lengthen d labours of a year troy walls i raised for such were jove s commands and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves along fair ida s vales and pendant groves but when the circling seasons in their train brought back the grateful day that crown d our pain

with swiftest wing and destined vengeance on the perjured king dost thou for this afford proud ilion grace and not like us infest the faithless race like us their present future sons destroy and from its deep foundations heave their troy apollo thus to combat for mankind ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind for what is man calamitous by birth they owe their life and nourishment to earth like yearly leaves that now with beauty crown d smile on the sun now wither on the ground to their own hands commit the frantic scene nor mix immortals in a cause so mean then turns his face farbeaming heavenly fires and from the senior power submiss retires him thus retreating artemis upbraids the quiver d huntress of the sylvan shades and is it thus the youthful phoebus flies and yields to ocean s hoary sire the prize how vain that martial pomp and dreadful show of pointed arrows and the silver bow now boast no more in yon celestial bower thy force can match the great earthshaking power silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid but furious thus what insolence has driven thy pride to face the majesty of heaven what though by jove the female plague design d fierce to the feeble race of womankind the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart thy sex s tyrant with a tiger s heart what though tremendous in the woodland chase thy certain arrows pierce the savage race how dares thy rashness on the powers divine employ those arms or match thy force with mine learn hence no more unequal war to wage she said and seized her wrists with eager rage these in her left hand lock d her right untied the bow the quiver and its plumy pride about her temples flies the busy bow now here now there she winds her from the blow the scattering arrows rattling from the case drop round and idly mark the dusty place swift from the field the baffled huntress flies and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes so when the falcon wings her way above to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove not fated yet to die there safe retreats yet still her heart against the marble beats to her latona hastes with tender care whom hermes viewing thus declines the war how shall i face the dame who gives delight to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night go matchless goddess triumph in the skies and boast my conquest while i yield the prize he spoke and pass d latona stooping low collects the scatter d shafts and fallen bow that glittering on the dust lay here and there dishonour d relics of diana s war then swift pursued her to her blest abode where all confused she sought the sovereign god weeping she grasp d his knees the ambrosial vest shook with her sighs and panted on her breast the sire superior smiled and bade her show what heavenly hand had caused his daughter s woe abash d she names his own imperial spouse and the pale crescent fades upon her brows thus they above while swiftly gliding down apollo enters ilion s sacred town the guardiangod now trembled for her wall and fear d the greeks though fate forbade her fall back to olympus from the war s alarms return the shining bands of gods in arms some proud in triumph some with rage on fire and take their thrones around the ethereal sire through blood through death achilles still proceeds oer slaughter d heroes and oer rolling steeds as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapours purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toils and terrors fill d the dreadful day high on a turret hoary priam stands and marks the waste of his destructive hands views from his arm the trojans scatter d flight and the near hero rising on his sight no stop no check no aid with feeble pace and settled sorrow on his aged face fast as he could he sighing quits the walls and thus descending on the guards he calls you to whose care our citygates belong set wide your portals to the flying throng for lo he comes with unresisted sway he comes and desolation marks his way but when within the walls our troops take breath lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung the opening folds the sounding hinges rung phoebus rush d forth the flying bands to meet struck slaughter back and cover d the retreat on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate and gladsome see their last escape from fate thither all parch d with thirst a heartless train hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain and gasping panting fainting labour on with heavier strides that lengthen toward the town enraged achilles follows with his spear wild with revenge insatiable of war then had the greeks eternal praise acquired and troy inglorious to her walls retired but he the god who darts ethereal flame shot down to save her and redeem her fame to young agenor force divine he gave antenor s offspring haughty bold and brave in aid of him beside the beech he sate and wrapt in clouds restrain d the hand of fate when now the generous youth achilles spies thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise so ere a storm the waters heave and roll he stops and questions thus his mighty soul what shall i fly this terror of the plain like others fly and be like others slain vain hope to shun him by the selfsame road yon line of slaughter d trojans lately trod no with the common heap i scorn to fall what if they pass d me to the trojan wall while i decline to yonder path that leads to ida s forests and surrounding shades so may i reach conceal d the cooling flood from my tired body wash the dirt and blood as soon as night her dusky veil extends return in safety to my trojan friends what if but wherefore all this vain debate stand i to doubt within the reach of fate even now perhaps ere yet i turn the wall the fierce achilles sees me and i fall such is his swiftness t is in vain to fly and such his valour that who stands must die howeer t is better fighting for the state here and in public view to meet my fate yet sure he too is mortal he may feel like all the sons of earth the force of steel one only soul informs that dreadful frame and jove s sole favour gives him all his fame he said and stood collected in his might and all his beating bosom claim d the fight so from some deepgrown wood a panther starts roused from his thicket by a storm of darts untaught to fear or fly he hears the sounds of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain and the barb d javelin stings his breast in vain on their whole war untamed the savage flies and tears his hunter or beneath him dies not less resolved antenor s valiant heir confronts achilles and awaits the war disdainful of retreat high held before his shield a broad circumference he bore then graceful as he stood in act to throw the lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe how proud achilles glories in his fame and hopes this day to sink the trojan name beneath her ruins know that hope is vain a thousand woes a thousand toils remain parents and children our just arms employ and strong and many are the sons of troy great as thou art even thou mayst stain with gore these phrygian fields and press a foreign shore he said with matchless force the javelin flung smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms he stands impassive in the ethereal arms then fiercely rushing on the daring foe his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow but jealous of his fame apollo shrouds the godlike trojan in a veil of clouds safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view dismiss d with fame the favoured youth withdrew meanwhile the god to cover their escape assumes agenor s habit voice and shape flies from the furious chief in this disguise the furious chief still follows where he flies now oer the fields they stretch with lengthen d strides now urge the course where swift scamander glides the god now distant scarce a stride before tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore while all the flying troops their speed employ and pour on heaps into the walls of troy no stop no stay no thought to ask or tell who scaped by flight or who by battle fell t was tumult all and violence of flight and sudden joy confused and mix d affright pale troy against achilles shuts

approach and tries to persuade his son to reenter the town hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain hector consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of achilles his resolution fails him and he flies achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of troy the gods debate concerning the fate of hector at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles she deludes hector in the shape of deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and hecuba their lamentations tears and despair their cries reach the ears of andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband she swoons at the spectacle her excess of grief and lamentation the thirtieth day still continues the scene lies under the walls and on the battlements of troy thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fear the herded ilians rush like driven deer there safe they wipe

youthful force with fainting knees shall labour in the course and yield the glory yours the steeds obey already at their heels they wing their way and seem already to retrieve the day meantime the grecians in a ring beheld the coursers bounding oer the dusty field the first who mark d them was the cretan king high on a rising ground above the ring the monarch sat from whence with sure survey he

by some god withheld lie sure disabled in the middle field for since the goal they doubled round the plain i search to find them but i search in vain perchance the reins forsook the driver s hand and turn d too short he tumbled on the strand shot from the chariot while his coursers stray with frantic fury from the destined way rise then some other and inform my sight for these dim eyes perhaps

youthful nestor jealous of his fame the award opposes and asserts his claim think not he cries i tamely will resign o peleus son the mare so justly mine what if the gods the skilful to confound have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice and vows omitted forfeited the prize if yet distinction to thy friend to show and please a soul desirous to bestow some gift must grace eumelus view thy store of beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore an ample present let him thence receive and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give but this my prize

friendship torn hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn so spoke antilochus and at the word the mare contested to the king restored joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain lifts the green ear above the springing plain the fields their vegetable life renew and laugh and glitter with the morning dew such joy the spartan s shining face oerspread and lifted his gay heart while thus he said still may our souls o generous youth agree t is now atrides turn to yield to thee rash heat perhaps a moment might control not break the settled temper of thy soul not but my friend t is still the wiser way to waive contention with superior sway for ah how few who should like thee offend like thee have talents to regain the friend to plead indulgence and thy fault atone suffice thy father s

so well how godlike hector died thus priam spoke and hermes thus replied you tempt me father and with pity touch on this sad subject you inquire too much oft have these eyes that godlike hector viewd in glorious fight with grecian blood embrued i saw him when like jove his flames he tossd on thousand ships and wither d half a host i saw but help d not stern achilles ire forbade assistance and

dead have dogs dismember d on the naked plains or yet unmangled rest his cold remains o favour d of the skies thus answered then the power that mediates between god and men nor dogs nor vultures have thy hector rent but whole he lies neglected in the tent this the twelfth evening since he rested there untouch d by worms untainted by the air still as aurora s ruddy beam is spread round his friend s tomb achilles drags the dead yet undisfigured or in limb or face all fresh he lies with every living grace majestical in death no stains are found oer all the corse and closed is every wound though many a wound they gave some heavenly care some hand divine preserves him ever fair or all the host of heaven to whom he led a life so grateful still regard him dead thus spoke to priam the celestial guide and joyful thus the royal sire replied blest is the man who pays the gods above the constant tribute of respect and love those who inhabit the olympian bower my son forgot not in exalted power and heaven that every virtue bears in mind even to the ashes of the just is kind but thou o generous youth this goblet take a pledge of gratitude for hector s sake and while the favouring gods our steps survey safe to pelides tent conduct my way to whom the latent god o king forbear to tempt my youth for apt is youth to err but can i absent from my prince s sight take gifts in secret that must shun the light what from our master s interest thus we draw is but a licensed theft that scapes the law respecting him my soul abjures the offence and as the crime i dread the consequence thee far as argos pleased i could convey guard of thy life and partner of thy way on thee attend thy safety to maintain oer pathless forests or the roaring main he said then took the chariot at a bound and snatch

state the work of soldiers where the hero sat large was the door whose wellcompacted strength a solid pinetree barr d of wondrous length scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight but great achilles singly closed the gate this hermes such the power of gods set wide then swift alighted the celestial guide and thus reveal d hear prince and understand thou owst thy guidance to no

now fearless enter and prefer thy prayers adjure him by his father s silver hairs his son his mother urge him to bestow whatever pity that stern heart can know thus having said he vanish d from his eyes and in a moment shot into the skies the king confirm d from heaven alighted there and left his aged herald on the car with solemn pace through various rooms he went and found achilles in his inner tent there sat the hero alcimus the brave and great automedon attendance gave these served his person at the royal feast around at awful distance stood the rest unseen by these the king his entry made and prostrate now before achilles laid sudden a venerable sight appears embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears those direful hands his kisses press d embrued even with the best the dearest of his blood as when a wretch who conscious of his crime pursued for murder flies his native clime just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed all gaze all wonder thus achilles gazed thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise all mute yet seem d to question with their eyes each look d on other none the silence broke till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke ah think thou favour d of the powers divine think of thy father s age and pity mine in me that father s reverend image trace those silver hairs that venerable face his trembling limbs his helpless person see in all my equal but in misery yet now perhaps some turn of human fate expels him helpless from his peaceful state think from some powerful foe thou seest him fly and beg protection with a feeble cry yet still one comfort in his soul may rise he hears his son still lives to glad his eyes and hearing still may hope a better day may send him thee to chase that foe away no comfort to my griefs no hopes remain the best the bravest of my sons are slain yet what a race ere greece to ilion came the pledge of many a loved and loving dame nineteen one mother bore dead all are dead how oft alas has wretched priam bled still one was left their loss to recompense his father s hope his country s last defence him too thy rage has slain beneath thy steel unhappy in his country s cause he fell for him

then with his hand as prostrate still he lay the old man s cheek he gently turn d away now each by turns indulged the gush of woe and now the mingled tides together flow this low on earth that gently bending oer a father one and one a son deplore but great achilles different passions rend and now his sire he mourns and now his friend the infectious softness through the heroes ran one universal solemn shower began they bore as heroes but they felt as man satiate at length with unavailing woes from the high throne divine achilles rose the reverend monarch by the hand he raised on his white

choir attend around with plaintive sighs and music s solemn sound alternately they sing alternate flow the obedient tears melodious in their woe while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart and nature speaks at every pause of art first to the corse the weeping consort flew around his neck her milkwhite arms she threw and oh my hector oh my lord she cries snatch d in thy bloom from these desiring eyes thou to the dismal realms for ever gone and i abandon d desolate alone an only son once comfort of our pains sad product now of hapless love remains never to manly age that son shall

concluding note we have now passed through the iliad and seen the anger of achilles and the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it i need not mention that troy was taken soon after the death of hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described by virgil in the second book of the æneid achilles fell before troy by the hand of paris by the shot of an arrow in his heel as hector had prophesied at his death lib xxii the unfortunate priam was killed by pyrrhus the son of achilles ajax after the death of achilles had a contest with ulysses for the armour of vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through indignation helen after the death of paris married deiphobus his brother and at the taking of troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to menelaus her first husband who received her again into favour agamemnon at his return was

by arnold the prize given to ajax was tecmessa while ulysses received laodice the daughter of cycnus the myrmidons dwelt on the southern borders of thessaly and took their origin from myrmido son of

cultivating the earth the change from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of their name which resembles that of the ant they bore a further resemblance to these little animals in that

to develop the disposition of ulysses in a new light in which mere cunning is less prominent of the gradual and individual development of homer s heroes schlegel well observes in basrelief the figures are usually in profile and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief they are not grouped together but follow one another so homer s heroes advance one by one in succession before us it has been remarked that the iliad is not definitively closed but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it the basrelief is equally without limit and may be continued ad infinitum either from before or behind on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension sacrificial processions dances and lines of combatants and hence they also exhibit basreliefs on curved surfaces such as vases or the frieze of a rotunda where by the curvature the two ends are withdrawn from our sight and where while we advance one object appears as another disappears reading homer is very much like such a circuit the present object alone arresting our attention we lose sight of what precedes and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow dramatic literature p there can not be a clearer indication than this description so graphic in the original poem of the true character of the homeric agora the multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent not often hesitating and never refractory to the chief the fate which awaits a presumptuous critic even where his virulent reproaches are substantially wellfounded is plainly set forth in the treatment of thersites while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even more by the excessive pains which homer takes to heap upon him

plausibly urged although the example of homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required nor perhaps such as would in ordinary cases suggest itself to the mind of a poet yet there is scarcely any portion of the iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period with the remainder of the work the composition of the catalogue whensoever it may have taken place necessarily presumes its authors acquaintance with a previously existing iliad it were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names most of them historically unimportant and not a few altogether fictitious or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety but through the medium of the iliad mure language and literature of greece vol i p twice sixty thucydides observes that the boeotian vessels which carried one hundred and twenty men each were probably meant to be the largest in the fleet and those of philoctetes carrying fifty each the smallest the average would be eightyfive and thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves and that very few besides the chiefs went as mere passengers or landsmen in short we have in the homeric descriptions the complete picture of an indian or african war canoe many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the greeks if the total number of the greek ships be taken at twelve hundred according to thucydides although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eightysix in the catalogue the amount of the army upon the foregoing average will be about a hundred and two thousand men the historian

philostratus his best beloved the following elegant remarks of thirlwall greece vol i p seq well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes one of the noblest and most amiable sides of the greek character is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable friendships and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in later times it was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society was held but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained was not the less admirable and engaging the heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by homer and partly in traditions which if not of equal antiquity were grounded on the same feeling seem to have but one heart and soul with scarcely a wish or object apart and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another it is true that the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality but this is a circumstance which while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents such were the friendships of hercules and iolaus of theseus and pirithous of orestes and pylades and though these may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to which the traditions are referred the argument of the iliad mainly turns on the affection of achilles for patroclus whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled prowess but the mutual regard which united idomeneus and meriones diomedes and sthenelus though as the persons themselves are less important it is kept more in the background is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light the idea of a greek hero seems not to have been thought complete without such a brother in arms by his side thirlwall greece vol i p seq

amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages zeus or jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent no distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable this seems to be the true character of the homeric deity and it is very necessary that the student of greek literature should bear it constantly in mind a strong instance in the iliad itself to illustrate this position is the passage where jupiter laments to juno the approaching death of sarpedon alas me says he since it is fated moira that sarpedon dearest to me of men should be slain by patroclus the son of menoetius indeed my heart is divided within me while i ruminate it in my mind whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle i should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own lycia or whether i should now destroy him by the hands of the son of menoetius to which juno answers dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man long since destined by fate palai pepromenon you may do it but we the rest of the gods do not sanction it here it is clear from both speakers that although sarpedon is said to be fated to die jupiter might still if he pleased save him and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event and further in the alternative that jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another coleridge p seq thrice at the battlements the art military of the homeric age is upon a level with the state of navigation just described personal prowess decided every thing the night

calaber coleridge greek classic poets p seq has diligently compared this with the description of the shield of hercules by hesiod he remarks that with two or three exceptions the imagery differs in little more than the names and arrangements and the difference of arrangement in the shield of hercules is altogether for the worse the natural consecution of the homeric images needs no exposition it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work the hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity mars and pallas are awkwardly introduced among the centaurs and lapithae but the gap is wide indeed between them and apollo with the muses waking the echoes of olympus to celestial harmonies whence however we are hurried back to perseus the gorgons and other images of war over an arm of the sea in which the sporting dolphins the fugitive fishes and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net are minutely represented as to the hesiodic images themselves the leading remark is that they catch at beauty by ornament and at sublimity by exaggeration and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem there is this curious peculiarity that in the description of scenes of rustic peace the superiority of homer is decisive while in those of war and tumult it may be thought perhaps that the hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage this legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the grecian mythology it explains according to the religious ideas familiar to the old epic poets both the distinguishing attributes and the endless toil and endurances of heracles the most renowned subjugator of all the semidivine personages worshipped by the hellenes a being of irresistible force and especially beloved by zeus yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor his recompense is reserved to the close of his career when his afflicting trials are brought

youngest of priam s sons and that he was treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent with him perhaps the boldest excursion of homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which in the twentyfirst of the iliad he has brought the river god scamander first with achilles and afterwards with vulcan when summoned by juno to the hero s aid the overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain torrents of greece and asia minor their wide shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger but a thundershower in the mountains unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river the rescue of achilles by the fiery arms of vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from physical causes yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero s destruction appeared imminent might by a slight

made by the trojans to possess themselves of the body which was however rescued and borne off to the grecian camp by the valour of ajax and ulysses thetis stole away the body just as the greeks were about to burn it with funeral honours and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in the isle of leuke in the euxine astyanax ie the cityking or guardian it is amusing that plato who often finds fault with homer without reason should have copied this twaddling etymology into his cratylus this book has been closely imitated by virgil in his fifth book but it is almost useless to attempt

that follows the remarks of coleridge are well worth reading by a close study of life and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations and to extricate himself from them with the completest success the whole scene between achilles and priam when the latter comes to the greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of hector is at once the most profoundly skilful and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the iliad quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of priam the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent that if genius did not often especially in oratory unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism we might be induced on this account alone to consider the last book of the iliad as what is called spurious in other words of later date than the rest of the poem observe the exquisite taste of priam in occupying the mind of achilles from the outset with the image of his father in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation and lastly mentioning hector s name when he perceives that the hero is softened and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror the ego deleeinoteros per and the apusato aecha geronta are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the iliad they are almost too fine and pathetic the whole passage defies translation for there is that about the greek which has no name but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language coleridge p achilles ferocious treatment of the corpse of hector can not but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity the heroic age however must be judged by its own moral laws retributive vengeance on the dead as well as the living was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul s admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river the complaint of the ghost of patroclus to achilles of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge which even after death was supposed to torment the dwellers in hades hence before yielding up the body of hector to priam achilles asks pardon of patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution mure vol i such was the fate of astyanax when troy was taken here from the tow r by stern ulysses thrown andromache bewail d her infant son merrick s tryphiodorus v the following observations of coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of helen s character few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency of achilles gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of helen she is through the iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her i have always thought the following speech in which helen laments hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in troy as almost the sweetest passage in the poem it is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the iliad from the rest classic poets p seq and here we part with achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character we had accompanied him through the effervescence undulations and final subsidence of his stormy passions we now leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise the frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the iliad to the speedy termination of its hero s course and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is united mure vol i p cowper says i can not take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much i am struck with the plain conclusion of it it is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertained magnificently neither pompous nor familiar not contemptuous yet without much ceremony
