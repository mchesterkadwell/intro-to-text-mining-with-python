    "## The Programming Language Python\n",
    "Python is a **general-purpose programming language** that can be used in many different ways; for example, it can be used to analyse data, create websites, automate boring stuff and write software with a graphical interface. Python is **excellent for beginners** because its basic syntax is simple and uncluttered with punctuation. Coding in Python often feels like writing in natural language. Python is a very popular language and has a large, friendly community of users around the world, so there are many tutorials and helpful experts out there to help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Text-Mining By Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could do a lot of text mining manually, by searching and counting through text by eye, or using the 'find and replace' function in a text editor. You could count and input numbers on a spreadsheet and do your analysis with formulae. However, with a large corpus of many thousands or millions of words these tasks are error-prone, boring and mind-boggling. It may even be impossible in the time available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use some of the specialist software tools out there for cleaning and exploring a corpus, and while these are definitely an option — and they could be used in combination with manual and programming techniques — here are several advantages to programming your text-mining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automation: coding automates boring and difficult tasks that are hard for humans to do.\n",
    "* Reproducibility: code both executes and unambiguously documents the steps to your results.\n",
    "* Clarity: coding forces you to understand exactly what you are doing with your text, promoting deep knowledge of the techniques you are using.\n",
    "* Bespoke: coding your own solution means you can design it to meet exactly what your research questions demand.\n",
    "* Advanced: coding may be the only way to do certain advanced analysis techniques or analyse extremely large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of any other advantages or disadvantages?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "R is another language well suited to text mining; in fact, the R language was designed specifically for data analysis and is widely used in many fields such as finance, medical research and social sciences. You *could* learn to do text analysis in R instead, but I recommend you choose either Python or R and stick to it. They are very different languages and for most people it is better to have deeper expertise in one programming language than spread yourself too thin.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in using R instead of Python then you should look at the book [Text Mining in R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), which uses the R package [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we have chosen Python on your behalf! In this workshop we will be using the Python library [Natural Language Tool Kit](http://www.nltk.org/) (don't worry, this need not make any sense to you yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'document' you are reading right now is a Jupyter notebook. It allows you to combine explanatory **text** and **code** that executes to produce the results you can see on the same page. You can also create and display graphs from your data in the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are particularly useful for *exploring* your data at an early stage in your research and *documenting* exactly what steps you have taken (and why) to get to your results. This documentation is extremely important for reproducibility of your research and to record what you did as you are guaranteed to forget in weeks or months down the line!\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on getting started with Jupyter Notebooks for your research try this [Jupyter Notebook for Beginners Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-for-beginners-a-tutorial-f55b57c23ada).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The box this text is written in is called a *cell*. It is a *text cell* marked up in a very simple language called 'Markdown'. Here is a useful [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). You can edit and then run cells to produce a result. Running this text cell produces formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main kind of cell is a *code cell*. The cell immediately below this one is a code cell. Running a code cell runs the code in the cell (marked by the **In**) and produces a result (marked by the **Out**). We say the code is **evaluated**.\n",
